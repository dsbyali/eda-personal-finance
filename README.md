# EDA on Synthetic Personal Finance Dataset 💰📊

This repository contains **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** performed on a **synthetic personal finance dataset**.  
The analysis focuses on understanding financial behavior across different **demographics, job types, loan statuses, and savings patterns**.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **File name:** `synthetic_personal_finance_dataset.csv`
- **Description:** The dataset contains synthetic (artificially generated) records of individuals’ financial and demographic information.  
- **Features include:**
  - **Demographics:** Age, Status (e.g., Student, Employed, Retired)  
  - **Financials:** Income, Expenses, Savings  
  - **Loans:** Has Loan (Yes/No), Loan Type (e.g., personal, education, housing)  
  - **Job Type:** Employment category (student, salaried, self-employed, etc.)  

*(Dataset is synthetic, so it does not represent real personal data.)*

## 🔍 EDA Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Checked and handled missing values
   - Data type conversions
   - Removed duplicates  

2. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Summary of numerical features (income, expenses, savings)
   - Distribution of categorical variables (job type, loan type, status)  

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Income distribution across job types  
   - Loan status vs. savings analysis  
   - Correlation heatmap  
   - Boxplots to detect outliers  

4. **Insights**
   - Which groups have higher loan dependency  
   - Spending vs. saving trends for students vs. employed people  
   - Relationship between job type and financial stability

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

## 📌 Purpose
- Practice **EDA on categorical + numerical features**  
- Understand financial behavior across demographics  
- Build data storytelling skills for **data science portfolio**

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Perform feature engineering (e.g., income-to-expense ratio).  
- Build predictive models (e.g., predict loan approval or savings likelihood).
